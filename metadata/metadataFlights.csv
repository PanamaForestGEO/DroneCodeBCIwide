I (Ian) tried to match the camera shutter timing with the GPS points, but this proved to be impossible. After manually choosing which images were valid (I just didn't include some on either end), Emlid then processed the data but said that there were multiple photos (up to 5) that had the exact same GPS point. I ended up having to manually assign the GPS information based on the droneÊ.ulgÊfile. Because of the GPS issue and the fast flight speeds of the drone in certain sections due to windspeed, there were anomalies with Metashape processing. For example, the software had trouble aligning all the images and I had to manually find tie points (because the camera trigger was too far apart for how fast the drone was going). The resulting orthomosaic was not fully aligned to June 2023, and after several tests I've tabled that effort as I believe it's dependent on having better GPS data than we currently have.",QGroundControl v4.4,Emlid Studio v1.7,Metashape v2.0.3.16960,Some cloud shadows in final orthomosaic,"Ian McGregor, Cesar Gutierrez, Vanessa Rubio, Evan Gora, Jeff Burchfield, Fernando Arauz",Evan Gora,"Evan Gora, gorae@caryinstitute.org"

The ""Return to mission"" command resulted in a tangle with a tree, thus we do not have images for the full island. Whether because we were still using DeltaQuad / Emlid for this or because this was still from the helipad, the GPS information did not line up when doing PPK processing (i.e. the number of events identified by Emlid was only 1 off from the number of images we had, but when I plotted the drone's GPS coordinates overlaid by Emlid's GPS coordinates, we had missing overlaps for at least 25 images).
