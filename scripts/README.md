# Code

The code is organized in numerical running order, e.g. `mod(ule)2` is run before `mod(ule)3`. Mod1 pertains to GPS correction and Mod2b is based on spectral analyses, neither of which are included here because they are not relevant to this specific analysis.

Folders
- The `cloudCompare` folder contains all the code files that call the CloudCompare software.
- The `original` folder contains the original script files (with converted terra functionality) from Cushman et al., which follow the `postAlignWorkflow.md` file within the same folder.
